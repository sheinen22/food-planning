# Food Planning App

Create a user by entering an email and a password, then clicking "sign up." From there, use the dropdown in the top right corner to fetch the recipes in the database.  Any changes you make (deleting a recipe, adding a recipe or editing a recipe) can be saved by first completing the form, clicking save, then going to the top right corner to the same dropdown and click "save data."  There is also an option to "add to shopping list" from a recipe, that will automatically add all of the ingredients to your shopping list located in a separate tab.  In that tab, you can add a new item to the shopping list, or delete items currently there.

# Future Notes:

* I want to add a pantry tab and a "cook recipe" button and eventually turn this into an inventory system type of app.
* Possibly pull in a recipes API where I can search for recipes based on the ingredients I have in the pantry, show full recipes, recipes that I need one more ingredient for, recipes that I need two more ingredients for, etc.
